This folder contains data harvested from in game and exported to SavedVariables.

Each file has a "DBContext", "DBFileName", and an "ItemDB" at bare minimum.

Example:
DBContext = "CLASSICERA";
DBFileName = "01 - Classic Era";
ItemDB = {};

If you are reharvesting for a specific expansion, replace the ItemDB contents for that file and then update the patch in the name of the file.
After doing so, simply run the Item DB Consolidator tool and it will build the 00 - Item DB/.dynamic folder based on this data.
