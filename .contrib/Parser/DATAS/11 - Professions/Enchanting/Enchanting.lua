-- Note: This file should eventually go away, because enchanting is now done by _Automation.lua and the "-Filtered" files.
--       Almost everything that was in this file has been removed since it duplicated the recipes that are in the Automation/Filtered files.
--       But there are a couple sections remaining that can't be deleted yet until their information is moved to other files.  The Enchanting
--       Study section needs to have its items moved to the garrison vendor files.  The Illusions section probably needs to be moved to
--       Craftable Items.
