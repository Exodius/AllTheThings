-- Defines the set of Fields which will be merged across all Sources of any object which matches the respective key Field
-- This makes it easy to ensure that certain types of groups always share common data, even when Sourced multiple times
-- e.g. if a group contains 'spellID=123' then all matching groups with 'spellID=123' will share the same 'type' and 'learnedAt' values
