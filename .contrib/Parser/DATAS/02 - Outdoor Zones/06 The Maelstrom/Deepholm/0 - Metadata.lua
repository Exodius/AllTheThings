Besides Therazane and her elementals, the Earthen Ring has also made Deepholm its temporary home. Stationed in the Temple of Earth, they are attempting to mend the wound Deathwing opened. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, Deepholm became accessible to players. It is the largest visitable level of the Elemental Plane, being a new questing, leveling and exploration zone tuned for level 30 players. It also holds a 5-man dungeon, the Stonecore. The two main enemy forces the player fight against are the Twilight's Hammer and a large tribe of stone troggs.",
