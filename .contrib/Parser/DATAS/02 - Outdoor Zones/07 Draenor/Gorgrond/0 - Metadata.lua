			["description"] = "Gorgrond is a zone in northern Draenor. It is home to the Blackrock clan and the industrial heart of the Iron Horde and their ancestral home, the Blackrock Foundry, lies near the northern coast. However the industrial efforts of the Blackrock are dwarfed by the perpetual war that rages across the region. Two groups of creatures, both descended from ancients, fight a furious, unending war to determine what form the region's landscape should take. Along the northern and western side of Gorgrond the mighty Breakers have created a barren desert with rocky mesas and hot-springs bubbling up from the ground. Along the southern and eastern side of the region the savage Primals have created a lush jungle with thick foliage and dangerous animate plant-life that waits to devour those foolish enough to stray into its depths. If either side triumphed over the other, then Gorgrond and all of Draenor would soon be transformed into the victor's favoured environment. For the Blackrock, however, this war acts as perfect barricade preventing invasion from the south, allowing them to churn out weapons for the Iron Horde unopposed.",
