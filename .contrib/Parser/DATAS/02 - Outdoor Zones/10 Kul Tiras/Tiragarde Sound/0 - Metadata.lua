Boralus, the capital of Kul Tiras, is located here.\n\nThe people of Tiragarde Sound are renowned monster hunters, raging battle against the creatures of the sea, and struggle every day against pirates at their own shores. While the pirates were once content to stay at Freehold, in recent months, they have grown bolder, and began attacking Tiragarde Sound. During the war between the Alliance and Horde, the area served as the Alliance's staging point and home base.",
