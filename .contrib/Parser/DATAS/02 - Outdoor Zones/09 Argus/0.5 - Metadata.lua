Jagged crystal mountains hold festering corruption within that cause them to crumble, and dust devils born of the powdered gems screech down canyons of serrated rock which refract light everywhere. There is a city which looms over canyons of fractured crystal and is laid out according to complex geomantic rules. The buildings resemble those of the draenei but far more grandiose. At the center of the city is a mighty palace that is home to Archimonde and Kil'jaeden. Within the palace's crystal corridors are runes which fill the mind with despair, visions of conquest, and a rage to end all things: the creed of the Burning Legion, written in fire.",
