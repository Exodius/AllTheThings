Like Borean Tundra, it is intended for fresh level 68-72 players and introduces them to a variety of factions and lore plots. However, it is considered more challenging to level in this zone because of the steep mountains and windy paths between quest objectives compared to the flat plains of Borean Tundra. Alliance players learn about the reawakened vrykul, the prototype for humans, while Horde players assist the Forsaken in developing a new plague (perhaps with ethical qualms) to defeat the Lich King. Both sides also assist the Tuskarr in putting the spirits of their ancestors to rest, as well as aiding a group of humorous pirates.|r",
