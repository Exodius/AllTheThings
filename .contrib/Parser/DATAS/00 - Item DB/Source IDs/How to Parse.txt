• Turn on Debug mode
• Use /attharvest (use /attharvest lownumber,highnumber to harvest itemIDs within a specific range)
• When you see the window flashing, just move it to the top of your screen and make it bigger
• Log out after it reaches 100%
• Go to World of Warcraft > _retail_ > WTF > account > [your account name] > SavedVariables > AllTheThings.lua
• Inside the file there's a table called "AllTheThingsHarvestItems"
• Copy that table to a new file
• Replace the "AllTheThingsHarvestItems" line with Harvest({ and then replace the closing } at the end of the file with });
• Save to the Source IDs folder — addons > AllTheThings > .contrib > Parser > DATAS > 00 - Item Database > Source IDs
• Run parser
• Sometimes Blizzard is dumb and the source ID failed to harvest, which means you need to change the modID and then try again
• In the case of Siege of Orgrimmar it didn't need any modID, so I used ignoreBonus on it before I ran the harvester

• The file you move into the Source ID's Folder has to be saved as .LUA file
• When you use the parser, it will eat/remove your file. Thats on purpose
