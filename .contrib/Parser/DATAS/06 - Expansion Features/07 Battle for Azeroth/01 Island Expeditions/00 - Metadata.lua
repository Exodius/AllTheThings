Goblins and gnomes have been able to use their new technology to find islands which contain possible amounts of Azerite and will be providing maps for each of their respective factions.  Ships and queuing will take places in Dazar'alor for Horde and Boralus for Alliance.  These unlock at level 116 on your first playthrough and should be open at 110 on your alts once you have finished the introduction line.",
