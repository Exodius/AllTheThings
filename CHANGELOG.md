# AllTheThings

## [SL-2.4.6](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.4.6) (2021-09-25)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.4.5...SL-2.4.6) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

### Highlights of this update

- Containers like Tribute of the Ambitious once again show their contents.
- All newly added Cataclysm Timewalking recipes are marked as available now (some were marked as removed from the game in previous release). Go buy them while you still can before reset!

### Notable changes:

- Fixed items having too many filters on them. Example: heirloom tokens that can be bought with PvP/holiday currencies had PvP and holiday filters applied to them. Due to this fix Items might show up in places they were previously being filtered due to never being tagged correctly for that specific Source of an Item. Just report it in discord.gg/allthethings #errors and it will be addressed. Thanks.
- Moved around and added/fixed some stuff in Legion and Battle for Azeroth including zone drops/rares/questlines.
- Battle Pet/Mount flavor text is now considered "Lore". You can disable lore descriptions in ATT Settings->Interface->Lore.
- More things should have PvP filter now.
- Once again fixed duplicate descriptions/lore/etc. sometimes showing for tooltips of ATT windows (hopefully permanently). (This was fixed twice since last release ðŸ¤­)
- Fixed some crafted tooltips showing completed Things when 'Show Completed Groups' is enabled.
- The generic 'Type' categories will no longer show in tooltips as 'Sources' for: Battle Pets/Mounts/Titles/Toys (i.e. ATT > Mounts > etc.).
- Mage Tower and The Deaths of Chromie moved to Expansion Features.
- Various fixes.
