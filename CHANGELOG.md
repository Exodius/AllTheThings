## [SL-2.3.2a](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.3.2a) (2021-06-07)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.3.2...SL-2.3.2a) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

This is a hotfix release to 2.2.3.
Main changes are:
- adding more things under Covenants filter
- fixing PvP stuff
- did you know we have `/att random` (or just `/att rand`) command? Now you know, go try it! Fixed this thing for Russian and Chinese clients
- Misc filter was removed and force enabled for everyone
- usual fixes here and there, see full list above

P.S. `/att random` was broken only in Russian and Chinese because only these two languages have good localization in ATT. If you want to break a feature or two while also bringing this addon to more users in your native tongue, reach out to us on Discord!
