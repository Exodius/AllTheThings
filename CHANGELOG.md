### Promotions

Earn the Big Battle Bear üêª through Prime Gaming until April 27, 2023. More details [here](https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23922954).

### Logic changes

- Added an event to track when tooltips need to be refreshed to hopefully make ATT tooltips more responsive when server data is retrieved while the tooltip is already displayed (please report if you notice any abnormal/detrimental behavior with tooltips).

### Logic fixes

- Internal rewrite of Settings which fixed Account-Wide toggles when not in Debug/Account Modes. This will also make it easier for us to add new settings (Drakewatcher Manuscripts are _almost_ ready, Hidden Quest Triggers are less ready).
- Fixed some internals to fix an issue where under Catalyst it would only fill LFR with class requirement and then skip the same class in other difficulties.
- Fixed a tooltip Lua bug for Items that Blizzard has assigned the 'Adventurer' class (whatever that is).
