### KNOWN ISSUES

Please don't spam us with these:

- Tooltips might stil break sometimes but they should be mostly fixed.
- Map icon is inside the minimap.
- You can't change profiles because the switch button is not functional.
- The autoreset on dungeons seems broken in `/attra`.


### Logic fixes

- Fixed ATT tooltips not showing up/disappearing in most situations.


### Data fixes

- Harvested Item/Quest/Achievement data, this should make new content behave as collectable and show up in lists.
