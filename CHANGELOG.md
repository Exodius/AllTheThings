### Logic changes

- Added useful display of what is required to make a specific Purchase. With counters and percentages! To view, right click any item that has costs assigned (examples: Jeweled Silver Dragon Goblet 200752, Bronze Drakonid Shoulderplates 199672, Crimson Proto-Whelp 199758).
- Simple Dynamic Groups which cannot be generated from Cache data will now generate using the Nested format (instead of not generating at all).
- Added a few Quest-based Dynamic group categories (Breadcrumb/Daily/Weekly).
- Improved Profession lists, Dynamic Nested groups, `/att filters`, `/att rwp`.
- Minor improvement to group update performance.
- 'Partial' completion Achievements which symlink their 'Full' completion Achievements now reference the criteria directly instead of nesting the Full inside the Partial.
- Automatically expanded windows will now ignore expanding Zone Drop/Common Boss Drop headers.
- ATT bindings are now in an 'All The Things' group instead of 'Addons'.


### Logic fixes

- `/att filters` results now clear their nested content (i.e. Heirloom Upgrades shouldn't be included for 'Dagger' search, etc.).
- Fixed certain situations where group updates could cause their completed parent to become hidden.
- Fixed tooltips on Monthly content.
- Fixed Instances with no Difficulty Headers not automatically expanding with the 'Expand Current Difficulty' enabled.
- Maps which are tied to an Achievement now display the Map name properly instead of the Achievement name.
