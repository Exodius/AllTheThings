### __"Completed By" checkbox__ âš™

Enable this option if you want to see the full list of characters on all servers that have completed the Quest in the tooltip (including Repeatable quests) (will probably need to adjust logic for those with a bajillion characters and such). You can find new setting in ATT Settings -> Interface -> Tooltips -> Shown Information (it's at the bottom of the tab).

### Notable changes:

- Popouts (right click) for Achievements should display any Criteria Sourced in ATT.
- Fixed Lua error in Profession list related to Profiles.
- Potentially fixed another Lua error reported after last release.
- Fixed some Alliance/Horde specific quests issues.
- Cleaned up a couple WQ-related Shadowlands Achievements so they are Sourced properly and show in `/attwq`.
- Various zones synchronized with ATT Classic: Stormwind City.
- Various Profession and Recipe fixes and reorganizations.
- Other fixes.
