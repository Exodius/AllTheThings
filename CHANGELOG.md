# AllTheThings

## [SL-2.9.8](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.9.8) (2022-09-25)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.9.7...SL-2.9.8) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Functional changes

- Overhauled internal logic concerning reputations: we will work with new Friedship repuatations better, including using proper colors. Also fixed some Lua errors concerning Friendships in the process.


### Logic fixes

- Screenshots ðŸ“¸ should now only be taken when collecting a Thing which is actually being tracked as collectible (note that screenshots are only triggered from automated checks of new Things, and many Types of Things do rely on manual refreshes and will not trigger screenshots when collected in this way).


### Data fixes

- More fixes for Battle for Azeroth PvP sets.
- Fixed Trashmaster Mantle AGAIN. This fix is for the version which specifically comes from Great Vault.
- Tiny changes for Brewfest and Hallow's End.
- Other fixes, quite a lot of fixed quest lines in this update.
