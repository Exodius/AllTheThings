## [SL-2.3.10](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.3.10) (2021-08-01)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.3.9...SL-2.3.10) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

### Highlight of this update

- We finally have Runecarving Powers tracking! (Hint: conduits tracking is next)

### Notable changes:

- Quest Objective Groups are now excluded from the Retail version of ATT due to the in-game Quest tracking being plenty sufficient for a vast majority of Quests in the game without needing to rely on ATT trying to track every possible Quest Objective while you are on a Quest. If anyone finds major concern with this, please let us know in #suggestions as to how/why seeing Quest Objectives in an ATT list is useful!
- Fixed Quests popped out from a Quest popout from showing the Source Quest as a Source (just a reminder that you can Right-click practically anything in ATT lists and it will bring more info)
- Fixed popouts that have been closed still playing a 'window-completion' sound (only plays if visible when being completed)
- Fixed Achievements/Holidays/Factions categories shifting in popouts
- Breadcrumb warning chat messages should now be clickable to open an ATT popout for that quest
- Minilist will now force update itself when being shown (i.e. fixes collecting things in the zone while the minilist is closed, then opening the list afterward)
- Fixed Quests not being visible in Party Sync if they were replayed/completed during the Party Sync session and 'Show Completed Things' is enabled
- Fixed various bugs and inconsistencies with objects (treasure chests)
- Fixed `/attwq` not showing certain Things in the list even when they are active (i.e. Argus Cloth/Plate sets from rares due to active WQ's)
- More rare/Adventure drops, treasure/rare coordinates/descriptions, recipes, dailies, new Campaign chapters, etc
- Various fixes
