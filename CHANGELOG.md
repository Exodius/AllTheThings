[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.6.8...SL-2.6.9) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Highlights of this update

#### Settings and Profiles

We have reviewed our default settings so hopefully they make more sense now. We now default to the Insane Character Completionist Mode. This should only affect new installs.

On a somewhat related note: Profiles are now out of beta and will be enabled for everyone. Your current settings will become your default profile. We will even remember your locked windows state and position/size per-profile!

#### Auction House module

AH Module disabled for the time being in ATT since it's currently not serving its intended purpose and just leading to confusion.

### Notable changes:

- Another pass at attempting to improve the performance of the minilist.
- Ongoing achievements cleanup: attaching required quests, maps, etc. Mainly in Darkmoon Faire and Covenant achievements.
- Consolidated the listing of the special Plate/Cloth sets from Argus. They are now only listed in one place in the respective zones, but will show in the same way as before in the actual zone or creature tooltips.
- Necrolord Abomination Factory rewards cleaned up to not be duplicated and showing rewards in `/attwq` when the quests are not actually rewarding an item.
- Other fixes.
