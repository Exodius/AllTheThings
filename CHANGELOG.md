### Notable changes:

- Updated more icons!
- More consolidation in WoD Garrison content.
- Sorted more WoD quests.
- Legion Class Hall updates for multiple classes.
- World Bosses will be at the top of the minilist once again.
- Fixed content being hidden because we made a mistake in merging logic for groups (Stormheim quests only showing for Archaeology characters, etc).
- Fixes to the map logic rewrite, should be less duplicated headers now.
- Narrowed inaccurate quest filter to only be if the quest requires a 'profession/class/race/customcollect' since it would report if someone disabled Seasonal filters and then accepted Seasonal quests.
- New store mount ðŸ˜»
- `/att random` for 'Everything' will now only return 'collectible' Things (based on current filters) instead of any visible group -> you won't be able to roll the whole zone/category anymore.
- Map names shown in tooltips should no longer show the same map name multiple times even when they are technically different 'maps' in-game.
- Other fixes.
