### Highlights of this update

Cataclysm Timewalking now includes some previously removed recipes, go buy them!

### Notable changes:

- Yet another pass at making 'cost' logic work better & more accurately without requiring multiple force-refreshes. WIP - May still need to identify outlier situations and determine cause/fix for those situations. Feel free to report in #errors channel on our Discord server anything weird. Discord link is discord.gg/allthethings
- Equalized a few more gender-based titles.
- Eversong Woods, Ghostlands, Deeprun Tram, Silvermoon City, Azuremyst Isle, Bloodmyst Isle and Brewfest were synced with Classic, feel free to report any bugs/removed content.
