# AllTheThings

## [SL-2.4.8](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.4.8) (2021-10-10)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.4.7...SL-2.4.8) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

### Highlights of this update

#### Icon updates
- Small color tweaks to WoD, MoP and TBC icons.
- Faction flag updated to a banner.
- Updated World drops icon nothing big just a better looking icon
- New Icons for Zone drops, Rewards, Vendor and weapon types including Heirloom, Artifact and Legendary

#### WoD deduplication
Started work on WoD dungeons clean up. Instead of listing the same gear piece in every dungeon we now have Common Dungeon Drop header. If you want to know where the particular piece drops, Right click it in the list to see new window with the Sources header. To see the particular dungeon with unique + common drops you can Right click it too.

### Notable changes:

- Did you know you can sort your ATT lists? Shift+Right click will sort them alphabetically by default and if you turn on Settings->Features->Sort By Progress it will uhm sort by progress. Sorting Factions now sorts based on current reputation level when not yet Exalted.
- Improved performance for refreshing appearances after a new ATT version release or force refresh (Shift+Click).
- Revised the Unique collection logic.

    Please let @ImUnicke in Discord know if you use Unique mode and notice a difference in performance when doing a force-refresh of your collection. Ideally use the ad-hoc update mode with the Main list closed for a more direct comparison.
- You should see less weird stuff (like Factions) in your profession list.
- Fixed collection logic for "Main Only" mode.
- Fixed search function for finding Shared Appearances in popout windows so that it will ensure to find a result which meets the current filters as a priority (i.e. ICC tier items sold by opposite faction vendors would be hidden, etc.).
- Sorting groups by Name will now properly sort Achievements.
- Fixed not showing "Collection Progress" in tooltips when no other information is displayed in the tooltip from ATT.
- Fixed duplicate tooltips (again).
- Warlock Legion Class Hall Clean Up.
- Hivemind mount has been added to the Secrets category.
- Various fixes.
