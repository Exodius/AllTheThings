### Logic changes

- Force-Refresh (Shift click on any ATT header or minimap button) now includes the Account-Wide / Once-Per-Account processing.
- ATT will now silently refresh collections when loading (previously this was only done on new versions due to lag on the refresh, but now a Unique Mode refresh takes under a single second typically and should be fine to include on start up).
- Minor performance improvements in Appearance refresh.


### Data additions/fixes

- Added LIMITED TIME Game Shop transmog set: The Guardian Pack. Sold for $8 until May 31st, will be available through Trading Post later this year. More info [here](https://www.wowhead.com/news/the-guardian-pack-medivh-inspired-transmog-set-on-in-game-shop-through-may-31st-332760).
