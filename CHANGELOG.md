### Trashmaster's Mantle

We've added another version of Trashmaster's Mantle! Rejoice!

### Notable changes:

- Fixed not being able to have a Character-Insane mode due to automated filters not giving credit towards 'Insane' status.
- We will load and update your known professions more reliably now.
- We will try a little harder to only fire "Incorrect quest data detected" messages when the data is in fact incorrect.
- And at the same time we didn't fire this message in some rare correct cases, this should be fixed as well now.
- Improved performance of profession windows, this should hopefully fix errors for some people.
- Added/fixed Season 4 content.
- Further clean up of achievements: Trial of the Crusader, Ice Crown Citadel, WotLK dungeons, Garrison Campaigns and others.
- Updated various WotLK dungeons: Utgarde Pinnacle, Utgarde Keep, Trial of the Champion, The Violet Hold, The Oculus, The Nexus, The Forge of Souls, The Culling of Stratholme, Pit of Saron.
- Garrison Campaign Quest chains are now consolidated in the Expansion Features -> WoD -> Garrison instead of being scattered across Draenor zones. You will still see individual quests in zone mini lists.
- Fixed some Burning Crusade dungeon tracking of saved instances (green checkmark in your lists) for German locale.
- Other fixes.
