[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.8.4...SL-2.8.5) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)


### Don't forget to collect new Midsummer Festival toys 🔥

### Quest Logic Updates ⁉

- Revamped `/attwq` Quest population to lag far less and pull in a more accurate assessment of available Quests.
- Opening a popout for a Quest will attempt to populate any API rewards as well (i.e. a Daily Quest with variable rewards *should* pull accurate rewards if the quest is available).
- Minilist (and other open ATT windows) will update their contents more reliably (requiring less forced updates from the user).

### Notable changes:

- Bits and pieces of French translation, thanks to @Machou! 🇫🇷
- Minilist 'cost' groups (which are not filled due to duplicate filled content already being filled elsewhere in the Minilist) will remain visible as regular 'cost' items in the same way as in the Main list for visibility.
- Various fixes for profession recipes.
- Various zones synchronized with ATT Classic: Arathi Highlands, Silverpine Forest.
- Various quest data updates (quite a lot!).
- Mechagon reformatting.
- Added all the goodies for buying Dragonflight 🐉
- Other fixes.
