### Twitch drops

You still have time until December 13th, 02:59 p.m. PST to get your FREE Cenarion Hatchling pet and Swift Windsteed mount by watching eligible Twitch streams. Check out details [here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/23891616).

### Logic fixes

- Fixed a Lua stack overflow when we add achievement criteria but forget to list achievement itself anywhere. We will just print an error message now instead of erroring out.

### Data fixes

- Fixes to lots of Dragon Isles questlines, world quests, pets, rares, treasures and achievements.
- Updates to many Faction/Renown specific activities and rewards (Grand Hunt, Iskaara fishing, etc).
- Lots of profession additions.
- Added new Twitch drops and Diablo IV promotional mount.
- Other fixes.
