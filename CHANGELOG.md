### Logic fixes

- This release should have noticeable speed improvements on 'large' operations (i.e. opening Main list, loading into the game, caching all ATT data, etc).
- Fixed filter ordering, i.e. if you load a minilist in Account mode, there may have been content referenced from an opposing Faction Source instead of your current character's Faction Source if both were available.
- Fixed tooltips for Quests in ATT lists.
- Fixed searching for Mount links from the mount journal.
- Fixed `EJ_GetTierInfo` randomly throwing errors.
- Slight adjustment to old style minimap button to align closer to the button.
- If an Achievement is unobtainable then its criteria will also be unobtainable now.
- Battle Pets are now properly refreshed when force refreshing ATT.
