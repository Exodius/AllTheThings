### Feast of Winter Veil üéÖüéÑü§∂

Don't forget to open your Winter Veil presents this year! It's 2 toys and 2 achievements this time around ‚õÑ
Happy Holidays! ‚ùÑ


### Functional changes

- Added an Icon for 'Reagents'.
- Added functionality to show 'Reagent' in tooltip/list when collectibles are inserted under a Reagent Item (similar to 'Currency' but based on Recipes instead of Costs).
- Added a few more automated top-level Headers for minilist generation (Bonus Objectives/Emissary Quests/Special/Weekly Holidays/World Quests/Zone Rewards)
- Added `/att rwp` chat command to show all Things that will be removed in the future (it's the same as the Main list dynamic category 'Future Unobtainables").
- When plotting waypoints, ATT will now print in chat if no coordinates could be determined. Use Alt+Right Click on quest, vendor, etc to plot a waypoint!
- Additionally, ATT will check upwards in the heirarchy for a related coordinate to utilize if none are found as normal (i.e. plotting a Recipe sold by a Vendor will now plot the Vendor instead of nothing).


### Functional fixes

- Fixed tooltip check for 'Retrieving data' for the Location text. It should be stuck on 'Retrieving data' less often now.
- Fixed an issue with reputation-granting Quests which were not able to be considered as 'costs' towards uncollected 'Friendship' Factions.
- ATT-created TomTom waypoints now properly persist based on TomTom settings rather than always being cleared on reload.
- Fixed tiny bug in setting a raw Item link from a chat command.
