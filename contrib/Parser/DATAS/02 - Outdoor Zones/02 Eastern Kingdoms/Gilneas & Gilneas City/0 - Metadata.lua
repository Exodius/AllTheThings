It is now home of Genn Graymane's worgen who have re-joined the Alliance once again since the Forsaken invasion and the Cataclysm wrecked their kingdom. Gilneas is a worgen-only leveling zone that relies heavily upon phasing. The starting zone covers how the player transforms into a Worgen, later aiding Graymane in trying to protect his kingdom from Sylvanas.|r",
